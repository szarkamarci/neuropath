# 🗺️ Business Concept Map: NeuroPath
**Model:** Digital Recruitment & Site Management Organization (SMO)

## 1. MARKET NEEDS / PROBLEMS (Blue Section)
*Focus: Why is the industry desperate?*

* **1.1 The Problem:** The EU Alzheimer's market is opening (e.g., Lecanemab approval), but Pharma needs massive "Real-World Data" for Phase 4 studies to keep these approvals.
* **1.2 The Pain Point:** **Recruitment Crisis.** Finding eligible early-stage patients costs **€6,500–€19,000 per person** using traditional methods. Current hospital sites are too slow and overloaded.
* **1.3 Target Audience:**
    * **Buyers:** Big Pharma (Medical Directors) & CROs.
    * **Partners:** General Practitioners (GPs) who need a simple, fast tool to filter patients.

## 2. VALUE PROPOSITION (Yellow Section)
*Focus: What do we actually deliver?*

* **2.1 The Solution (Elevator Pitch):**
    > "**NeuroPath** is a **Digital Patient Recruitment & Triage Platform** that addresses **the scarcity of eligible early-stage patients** for **Big Pharma**, offering **a rapid, tablet-based pre-screening network** validated by neurologists, paid by **Study Sponsorship Fees**."
* **2.2 Uniqueness (USP):**
    * **"Medically Validated Agility."** Unlike hospitals with 9-month setup times, we can deploy screening tablets to GP practices in **48 hours**.
* **2.3 Competitive Advantage:**
    * **The Investigator Network.** We don't just sell software; we provide a legally compliant "Site Management" service that solves the administrative burden for doctors.

## 3. REVENUE STREAMS (Pink Section)
*Focus: How we get paid legally.*

* **3.1 Sales Channels:** Direct B2B contracts with Medical Directors of Pharma subsidiaries (Hungary/CEE region).
* **3.2 Revenue Model:**
    1.  **Site Activation Fee:** Upfront payment to train GPs and deploy tablets (Setup).
    2.  **Success Fee:** Per-patient fee for every qualified referral (approx. **€2,000–€5,000**).
    3.  **Data Subscription:** (Phase 2) Recurring revenue for access to registry data trends.
* **3.3 Vision:**
    * **Current:** The fastest recruitment network in Hungary via tablets.
    * **Future:** Full EESZT integration to automate national population screening.

## 4. CORE TEAM (White Section)
*Focus: Credibility and Safety.*

* **4.1 Founders:**
    * **Principal Investigator (Neurologist):** Critical for signing protocols and ensuring medical soundness.
    * **Ops Lead (Business):** Manages the physical logistics of the GP network and contracts.
* **4.2 External Partners:**
    * **GPs:** The "Satellite Sites" using the tablets.
    * **Software Dev Partner:** Responsible for security and the eventual EESZT bridge.
    * **Legal Counsel:** Specialized in GCP (Good Clinical Practice) compliance.

## 5. CORE COMPETENCIES (Green Section)
*Focus: Our "Moat".*

* **5.1 Distinctive Competencies:**
    * **Proprietary Algorithm:** A validated digital scoring system (faster and more sensitive than paper tests).
    * **Regulatory Knowledge:** Deep understanding of "Non-Interventional Study" laws in Hungary to ensure compliant doctor payments.
* **5.2 Fundamental Conditions:**
    * **GDPR Compliance:** Secure, encrypted independent cloud storage (essential before EESZT integration).

## 6. COST / EXPENSES & CASH FLOW (Light Blue Section)
*Focus: Financial Health.*

* **6.1 Cost Structure:**
    * **Hardware:** Purchase and distribution of tablets to GP sites.
    * **Investigator Payments:** Pass-through fees to doctors (funded by the Pharma sponsor).
* **6.2 Funding Needs:**
    * **Seed Capital:** Required to fund the technical development of the **EESZT Integration module** (The "Future" asset) and the initial Legal Protocol setup.
    * **Burn Rate:** Low initially (software is built), costs scale linearly with the number of tablets deployed.
